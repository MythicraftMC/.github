<summary><b>Notice for all Mythicraft developers.</b></summary>

### Hey! Listen up!
Please follow [Section II of the Mythicraft Staff Policies](https://docs.mythicraft.org/link/2#bkmrk-this-section-mainly-)

Remember; We can suspend your MythiID at any time, and this will theirfor terminate access to all Mythicraft internal applications, websites, and CLI tooling.

We ***do not*** tolerate any sort of leaking of internal code. If you are found to have leaked code, we will terminate your Mythiccount until further notice, and investigate the situation. You could potentially not return on the staff team, have a permanent network suspension, loose privileges, or more. You are responsible for your personal security practices, and therefor should be careful when downloading unknown executable files.

For any further questions, please ask Erick.

Thanks, and we hope you have a good time developing for our network!
