<summary><b>Notice for all Mythicraft developers.</b></summary>

### Hey! Listen up!

Hiya! We know you may be excited to show off all the cool stuff you've developed for the network; However, please remember that all pre-release information is ***strictly confidential***. This includes:
- Infrastucture Information
- Game Info
- Game Mechanics
- Lore
- Backend Code
- Database Information
- Your MythiID information

Remember; We can suspend your MythiID at any time, and this will theirfor terminate access to all Mythicraft internal applications, websites, and CLI tooling.

Please remember to follow the ***Mythicraft Developer License*** while working for the network.

We ***do not*** tolerate any sort of leaking of internal code. If you are found to have leaked code, we will terminate your MythiID until further notice, and investigate the situation. You could potentially not return on the staff team, have a permanent network suspension, loose privileges, or more. You are responsible for your personal security practices, and therefor should be careful when downloading unknown executable files.

For any further questions, please ask Erick.

Thanks, and we hope you have a good time developing for our network!
